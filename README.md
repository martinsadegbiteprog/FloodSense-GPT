🌊 FloodSense-GPT

LLM-Powered Flood Risk Analysis &amp; Early Warning System  

FloodSense-GPT is an intelligent flood monitoring and decision-support system that combines machine learning, hydrological modeling, and large language models (LLMs) to predict flood risks and generate human-readable explanations for actionable insights.

🚀 Overview

Flooding is a major environmental challenge, especially in urban regions with poor drainage and rapid population growth. FloodSense-GPT addresses this by:

Predicting flood risk using environmental data
Explaining risks using Generative AI
Providing mitigation recommendations
Enabling interactive, map-based visualization

This project bridges the gap between technical flood modeling and accessible decision-making tools.

🎯 Features
📊 Flood Risk Prediction
Uses ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, or LSTM)
Inputs:
Rainfall intensity
River discharge
Soil moisture
Elevation data
Outputs:
Flood probability score
Risk classification (Low / Medium / High)

🧠 LLM-Based Explanation Engine
Converts numerical predictions into natural language insights
Provides:
Flood alerts
Engineering interpretation
Emergency recommendations

Example Output:

High flood risk detected due to sustained heavy rainfall and saturated soil conditions. Immediate drainage intervention and evacuation planning are recommended.

📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Integrates a knowledge base containing:
Flood management guidelines
Hydrology research papers
Engineering manuals (e.g., HEC-RAS, HEC-HMS)
Enables context-aware Q&A for flood mitigation strategies
